# ini file 

An INI file is a configuration file used by Windows programs to initialize program settings. It contains sections for settings and preferences (delimited by a string in square brackets) with each section containing one or more name and value parameters.

this file is `key=value` type.

At the top of this key value  we define `section` it means define a group of data 

for example 

auth.ini

```
[auth]
username=moeen.tavakoli
password=12345
```

in this case we define a section with name auth for authentication information.
